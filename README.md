# MRI_graymatter_segmentation
### Segmenting gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid from MRI images using Multi-Otsu, K-Means, SMIC, GMM and preprocessing such as CLAHE, NLM, thresholding etc.
This project focuses on applying traditional image processing and old-school computer vision techniques to segment gray matter, white matter and CSF on MRI images of the brain. It is then compared to state-of-art deep learning models' performance.
